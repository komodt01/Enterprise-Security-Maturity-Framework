# Enterprise Security Maturity Framework

This project provides a complete enterprise security maturity model to assess current-state security
capabilities, identify gaps, prioritize risk, and build strategic roadmaps.

The framework is aligned to:
- CISSP domain structure
- NIST CSF and ISO 27001 control categories
- Zero Trust and Cloud Adoption Frameworks
- Enterprise governance and risk management principles

It is designed to be:
- Business-aligned
- Technology-neutral
- Cloud-agnostic
- Repeatable and actionable

The model supports use in financial, healthcare, SaaS, cloud-migration, and regulated environments.

## Domains Covered

- Governance & Risk
- Identity & Access Management
- Monitoring & Logging
- Cloud Platform
- Data Protection
- Network Security
- DevSecOps & CI/CD
- Third-Party / Vendor Risk

Each domain includes:
- Maturity definition (1–5 scale)
- Capabilities scored
- Business impact
- Gap analysis inputs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Maturity Scale

Level 1 = Ad Hoc  
Level 2 = Repeatable  
Level 3 = Defined  
Level 4 = Measured  
Level 5 = Optimized  

This allows measurement of current vs target maturity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Framework Outputs

This framework produces:
- Score sheet and scoring matrix
- Gap register
- Ranked risk and maturity priorities
- Strategic roadmap

Artifacts are provided in the repo as examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who This Project Is For

- Security architects
- Cloud architects
- CISOs and leadership
- Risk and compliance teams
- Architecture and engineering groups
- Organizations undergoing transformation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Use This Repository

1. Review the domains and maturity scales.
2. Score the current vs target maturity.
3. Use the scoring matrix and templates.
4. Identify gaps and classify their impact.
5. Use the roadmap templates to build an improvement plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Continuous Improvement

Security maturity is not a static goal. This model can be reused during:
- Cloud transformation
- Security modernization
- Architecture reviews
- Recurring assessment cycles
- Budgeting and planning
- M&A integration

Reassess periodically and iterate based on business drivers and risk posture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

This framework is meant to provide:
- A clear, repeatable methodology
- Architecture-level security evaluation
- Executive and technical decision support
- Consistent roadmap development

It is not vendor-specific and does not assume any tooling or platform.
