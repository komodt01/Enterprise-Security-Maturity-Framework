# Third-Party & Vendor Risk Maturity Model

Third-party/vendor risk maturity measures how effectively an organization evaluates, governs,
monitors, and enforces controls for external entities that access systems, data, cloud platforms,
or infrastructure. This domain is tightly aligned with governance, data protection, IAM, and cloud
platform maturity.

---

## 1. Scope of the Vendor Risk Domain

This domain includes:

- Third-party onboarding and due diligence
- Data access and integration controls
- Contractual security requirements
- Continuous assurance and vendor monitoring
- Shared responsibility and SLA/SLO enforcement
- Offboarding and access removal
- Cloud/SaaS vendor governance
- Risk scoring and segmentation
- Audit and evidence collection

Covers legal, operational, and security perspectives.

## 2. Maturity Levels

### Level 1 – Ad Hoc
- No formal vendor risk management program.
- Access is granted informally and inconsistently.
- No due diligence or contractual security requirements.
- Vendor risk is discovered only after incidents.

### Level 2 – Repeatable
- Some vendor onboarding process exists.
- Basic assessment or questionnaire for critical vendors.
- Manual approvals, limited documentation.

### Level 3 – Defined
- Formal vendor risk management lifecycle.
- Defined processes for onboarding, due diligence, and assessment.
- Contracts include security requirements.
- Vendor inventory and classification maintained.

### Level 4 – Measured
- Vendor risk scoring and tiering.
- Regular assessment cycles and security reviews.
- Automated monitoring and threat intelligence.
- SLA/SLO enforcement and audit evidence tracking.

### Level 5 – Optimized
- Continuous vendor risk evaluation and monitoring.
- Automated access and permission governance.
- Real-time visibility into vendor compliance and posture.
- Data flow, identity access, and zero-trust controls enforced.

## 3. Capabilities to Score

| Capability | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Vendor Inventory | Classification and tiering |
| Due Diligence | Assessment coverage, questionnaires |
| Contract Requirements | Security clauses, SLAs, shared responsibility |
| Monitoring | Continuous posture awareness |
| Identity & Access | Least privilege, onboarding/offboarding |
| Data Protection | Encryption, loss prevention |
| Integration Controls | API, SaaS, third-party access |
| Audit | Evidence and tracking |

---

## 4. Business Impact of Vendor Risk Maturity

Improves:

- Supply chain resilience
- Trust and reputation
- Regulatory compliance (FFIEC, PCI, SOX)
- Cloud and SaaS adoption
- Risk visibility across ecosystems

Reduces:

- Data leakage and compromise
- Operational dependency failures
- SLA and availability impact

---

## 5. Drivers of Target Maturity

Target maturity depends on:

- Number of vendors and SaaS platforms
- Regulatory requirements
- Outsourcing and cloud reliance
- Data protection requirements
- Criticality of workloads

Not every vendor needs Level 5 controls—critical vendors do.

---

## 6. Inputs to Gap Analysis

Artifacts include:

- Vendor inventory and classification
- SOC2, ISO27001, or audit reports
- Cloud vendor shared-responsibility models
- Access/identity boundaries
- Contract clauses and SLA terms
- Third-party integration diagrams

These inputs guide roadmap prioritization.
