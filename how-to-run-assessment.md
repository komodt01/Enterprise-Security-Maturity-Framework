# How to Run a Security Maturity Assessment

This file provides the step-by-step playbook for running a maturity assessment using this framework.

---

## Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

Include representatives from:

- Security
- Cloud and infrastructure
- DevOps
- Compliance
- Business and operations

Document expectations and scope.

---

## Step 2: Gather Evidence

Artifacts may include:

- Network diagrams
- Cloud landing zone documentation
- IAM policies
- Vendor inventory
- Audit results
- Cloud logging and SIEM configuration
- Scoring interviews

---

## Step 3: Score Each Domain

Score each capability across the 1–5 scale:

1 = Ad Hoc  
2 = Repeatable  
3 = Defined  
4 = Measured  
5 = Optimized  

Refer to the `scoring-matrix.md` and domain files.

---

## Step 4: Identify Gaps

Document:

- Current level
- Target level
- Gap size
- Business impact
- Dependencies

Use a gap register for tracking.

---

## Step 5: Prioritize by Risk

Each gap should be ranked by:

- Business impact
- Regulatory requirement
- Probability
- Alignment with goals
- Cost and time to implement

---

## Step 6: Build the Roadmap

Group initiatives into:

- Quick wins (≤ 3 months)
- Medium horizon (3–12 months)
- Long-term transformational (12+ months)

This aligns with resource planning and budgeting.

---

## Step 7: Present Results

Outputs include:

- Score sheet
- Gap analysis
- Domain maturity table
- Roadmap
- Bar chart and comparison matrix

These artifacts are already in this project.

---

## Step 8: Continuous Improvement

Re-run the assessment every:

- 6 months for fast-moving orgs
- 12 months for stable orgs

The framework supports iterative improvement.
