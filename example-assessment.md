## Key Strengths

- Formal vendor risk management controls
- Data Protection policies and architecture are established
- IAM program defined but under-enforced

---

## Top Gaps

1. Cloud platform lacks a landing zone strategy
2. Inconsistent and manual CI/CD pipeline controls
3. Limited SIEM visibility and alerting coverage
4. Partial IAM automation and lifecycle controls

---

## Priority Recommendations

- Build a cloud landing zone and Multi-Account structure
- Implement CI/CD security controls organization-wide
- Improve central logging, SIEM coverage, dashboards
- Deploy MFA and access governance broadly

---

## Roadmap Overview

Quick Wins:
- Audit IAM access and baseline MFA
- Implement centralized logging ingestion

Medium Horizon:
- Deploy IaC for identity, network, guardrails
- Onboard critical workloads to landing zone

Long-Term:
- Zero Trust enforcement
- Automated continuous compliance

This assessment demonstrates how the model is applied to a real context.
