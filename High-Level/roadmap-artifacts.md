# Roadmap Artifacts

This directory contains artifacts generated after completing a maturity assessment and gap analysis.
These artifacts translate assessment results into actionable change.

The roadmap artifacts represent the **output** of the maturity model:

---

## 1. Gap Register

A prioritized list of gaps identified in the assessment. Each entry includes:

- Capability affected
- Current maturity level
- Target maturity level
- Gap size
- Business impact
- Risk rating
- Dependencies

Format reference: see `gap-analysis.md`.

---

## 2. Risk Ranking

Gaps are ranked to determine which roadmap items deliver the greatest benefit:

- Based on maturity gap
- Business criticality
- Regulatory or audit urgency
- Cost and effort of remediation

Format reference: see `risk-ranking.md`.

---

## 3. Roadmap Initiatives

These are the remediation items derived from the gaps. For each initiative:

- Objective
- Sponsor/owner
- Time horizon (0–3 / 3–12 / 12+ months)
- Dependencies
- Success criteria

These form the actionable roadmap the organization executes.

---

## 4. Improvement Plan

Optional deeper detail for each major initiative including:

- Scope
- Milestones
- Deliverables
- Risks and assumptions
- Budgetary considerations

May be converted into a program plan, steering committee output, or quarterly OKRs.

---

## 5. Continuous Improvement Loop

As governance processes mature:

- Re-run the assessment
- Update maturity scores
- Adjust roadmap priorities
- Feed learnings into business strategy

These artifacts become living documents, not one-time deliverables.
